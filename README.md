# hello-world
Just another hello world program.

Hi there! I'm a 20-yr-old working class Texan learning C and C++ to better provide for my family. I'm currently taking the PearsonVUE courses with supplementary stuff from other sources on the net, and I'll hopefully be posting some work here for assessment/criticism as I learn and getting involved in others' projects to expand my skills.

I'd love to hear from anyone and everyone about anything programming or computers-related; there isn't a very well developed computer culture in my area, much less any programmers, so it can get a little lonely :P
